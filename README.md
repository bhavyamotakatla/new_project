   ***Little Introduction About Me***
   -----
   
   I Myself Bhavya Motakatla prefered calling Bhavya. I'm an international student came to do my graduation degree in Computer Science department
   Pursing my 1st year 2nd sem. During my undergraduate I have learned a lot within the field of Computers. Few of the subjects  
   I found interesting in Database systems and Computer networks, I was amazed by the network models and the various architectures and protocols involved.
   My undergraduate studies enabled me to grasp the fundamentals related to Computer Science.
   and Engineering. After my under graduation, I was one of the few candidates selected in recruitment process of EPAM SYSTEMS,which is worldâ€™s largest world IT service provider. This placement had harvested the
hardwork in my graduation and boosted me of being capable to be into an IT company.
Although my role as software engineer in Epam systems has helped me gain extensive
knowledge in the field, I am certain that Masters Program is going to provide me proper
exposure to my interested field of study and become an industry ready. Therefore, after a lot of
contemplation and speaking to my professors and colleagues I have decided to pursue my MS
Degree in Computer Science. The field of computer science is vast and the advancements in this
field are tremendous. Being part of this intriguing field, if I could contribute even 1% to it I
would be overwhelmed.

My ultimate goal in my career is to make a commendable contribution to the computing world, either by starting an innovative venture or doing research which would change the dimensions of future computing and the way we perceive the computers. I believe that a dedicated study would enable me to achieve my career goals. After doing further research on the university and
going through its website I realized that your reputed University has a strong faculty and
research facilities in Computer science. It would be an honor and an enriching experience for me
to work under such great professors and learn more about the field. I am confident that this
University would provide me with the right kind of facilities and opportunities I require to realize
my professional goals. I believe in hard work and will be persistent towards achieving my goal.
