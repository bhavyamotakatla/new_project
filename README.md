   ***Little Introduction About Me***
   -----
   
   I Myself Bhavya Motakatla prefered calling Bhavya. I'm an international student came to do my graduation degree in Computer Science department
   Pursing my 1st year 2nd sem. During my undergraduate I have learned a lot within the field of Computers. Few of the subjects 
   
   that 
   I found intriguing were Database systems and Computer networks, I was amazed by the network models and the various architectures and protocols involved.
   My undergraduate studies enabled me to grasp the fundamentals related to Computer Science 
   and Engineering.After my graduation, I was one of the few candidates selected in recruitment process of EPAM SYSTEMS,which is worldâ€™s largest world IT service provider. This placement had harvested the
hardwork in my graduation and boosted me of being capable to be into an IT company.
Although my role as software engineer in Epam systems has helped me gain extensive
knowledge in the field, I am certain that Masters Program is going to provide me proper
exposure to my interested field of study and become an industry ready. Therefore, after a lot of
contemplation and speaking to my professors and colleagues I have decided to pursue my MS
Degree in Computer Science. The field of computer science is vast and the advancements in this
field are tremendous. Being part of this intriguing field, if I could contribute even 1% to it I
would be overwhelmed.
